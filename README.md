# url_redirect_with_keypress
Facebook has a nice feature, which is when left or right arrow keys are pressed the next or previous images load respectively. We download many wallpapers and in many sites there are many set of pages which contain the images of wallpapers. every time there is a need to click on the hyperlinks they gave to load next page which is quite cumbersome and someone might be too lazy too click it every time. Therefore this small javascript can be used in tampermonkey extension in google chrome to achieve navigation between websites just by he key-press of arrow keys. Remember this script can be modded to use with many websites only condition is next page should end with a number.
# USAGE
usage is very simple. all you need to do is just press keys :P .
this code only works for the website URL's ending with a number. i mainly considered this website during developing this script
if URL is http://wallpaperswide.com/celebrities-desktop-wallpapers/page/10 and you want to convert it to http://wallpaperswide.com/celebrities-desktop-wallpapers/page/9 just press left arrow key.
if URL is http://wallpaperswide.com/celebrities-desktop-wallpapers/page/10 and you want to convert it to http://wallpaperswide.com/celebrities-desktop-wallpapers/page/11 just press right arrow key.
