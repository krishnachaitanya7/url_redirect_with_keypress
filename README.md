# url_redirect_with_keypress
Facebook has a nice feature, which is when we press left or right arrow keys the next or previous images load respectively
We download many wallpapers and in many sites there are many set of pages which contain the images of wallpapers the website holds. everytime we need to click on the hyperlinks they gave to load next page which is quite cubersome and i am too lazy too click it everytime :)
therefore i developed this small javascript which can be loaded as tampermonkey extension in google chrome.
# USAGE
usage is very simple. all you need to do is just press keys :P .
this code only works for the website URL's ending with a number. i mainly considered this website during developing this script
if URL is http://wallpaperswide.com/celebrities-desktop-wallpapers/page/10 and you want to convert it to http://wallpaperswide.com/celebrities-desktop-wallpapers/page/9 just press left arrow key.
if URL is http://wallpaperswide.com/celebrities-desktop-wallpapers/page/10 and you want to convert it to http://wallpaperswide.com/celebrities-desktop-wallpapers/page/11 just press right arrow key.
